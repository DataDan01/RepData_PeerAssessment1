Then we will plot the daily activity pattern.\n\n```{r}\nintervalmean<-tapply(activitydata$steps,activitydata$interval,mean,na.rm=TRUE)\nplot(x=dimnames(intervalmean)[[1]],y=intervalmean,type=\"l\", main = \"Daily Activity Pattern\", xlab = \"Intervals - 5 Minutes\", ylab = \"Interval Means\")\n```\n\n## Imputing missing values\n\nThere seems to be a notable number of missing values. Let's take a look:\n```{r}\nsum(is.na(activitydata$steps))\n```\nLet's try to fill the missing values with the means for that interval. First, we will create a copy of the data set so we can fill it. Next, we will create a loop to replace the NAs. \n\n```{r}\nactivitydata2<-activitydata\n\nfor(i in 1:nrow(activitydata2))\n    {\n        if(is.na(activitydata2$steps[i]))\n        {\n            k<-activitydata2$interval[i]\n            k<-as.character(k)\n            activitydata2$steps[i]=intervalmean[intervalmean=k]\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nLet's see how filling in the missing values affected the data.\n\n```{r}\ntotaldailysteps2<-tapply(activitydata2$steps,activitydata2$date,sum)\nhist(totaldailysteps2, xlab = \"Total Daily Steps\", main = \"Histogram of Total Daily Steps with NAs Replaced\")\n```\n\nThe data have gravitated more towards the center. What happened to the mean and median?\n\nMedian:\n```{r}\nallmedians2<-tapply(activitydata2$steps,activitydata2$date,median)\nsummary(allmedians2)\n```\n\nMean:\n```{r}\nallmeans2<-tapply(activitydata2$steps,activitydata2$date,mean)\nsummary(allmeans2)\n```\n\nThese values differ from the estimates from the first part but not by much. The spread of the means has been compressed a little bit tighter around the grand mean, which remained unchanged. Most of the median distribution is still 0 because of the shear number of 0s in the data set. \n\n## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?\n",
